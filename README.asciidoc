This project, called http://www.walkmod.com[walkmod], is an open source tool to apply coding conventions. Walkmod can support with 
any programing language if a set of interfaces are implemented as a third party plugin. The first (and current)
supported language is Java. So, walkmod is completely modularized and you can extend their features (like Maven), 
by plugins (see http://walkmod.com/plugins.html[plugins] ). 

This respository contains the core library to load the configuration files and apply a chain of code transformations ( file by file ) 
and required to build plugins. Anyway, you can use this library to help us to create a Walkmod ecosystem where other development tools
(i.e Eclipse, Maven) can execute walkmod in an embedded mode instead of forcing a manual installation.

The https://github.com/rpau/walkmod-cmd[walkmod-cmd] project is just the responsable to build the tool - a zip file which all walkmod libraries, the default 
configuration and the scripts to execute walkmod. 

== Usage

You just need the following dependency:

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.walkmod</groupId>
    <artifactId>walkmod-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.0</version>
</dependency>
----

The `org.walkmod.WalkmodFacade` can help you to invoke the walkmod commands by API.

== Contributing
